
You are an expert UI/UX designer and frontend developer. Your task is to analyze the following web application and propose specific, actionable enhancements to its user interface and user experience.

## Application Context

**Purpose:** The application is an AI-powered SEO audit tool called "Crawlin.io" designed for developers. It allows users to connect their GitHub account, select repositories, run an SEO audit on the code, and receive AI-generated suggestions for fixes.

**Tech Stack:**
*   **Framework:** Next.js (App Router)
*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **UI Library:** React
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
*   **Component Library:** ShadCN UI (with `lucide-react` for icons)
*   **Theme:** A custom dark theme with a black background (`#000`), white text, and a vibrant blue for primary actions and accents (`hsl(217 91% 60%)`). The overall aesthetic is modern, clean, and developer-focused.

### Core Application Pages & UI Components:

1.  **Landing Page (`/`):** A standard marketing page with the following sections:
    *   **Hero:** A prominent headline, description, and call-to-action buttons. Features a code block animation to show SEO fixes.
    *   **How It Works:** A 4-step process illustrated with icons and short descriptions in cards.
    *   **Demo:** An embedded video placeholder.
    *   **Testimonials:** Customer quotes in cards.
    *   **Pricing:** A 3-tier pricing table.
    *   **About:** A brief company mission statement next to an image.
    *   **Layout:** Standard `Header` and `Footer`.

2.  **Dashboard (`/dashboard`):** The main functional area of the app.
    *   **Repo Selection:** Users can select repositories from a list using checkboxes.
    *   **Audit Control:** A "Run Audit" button that becomes active when repos are selected.
    *   **Results Display:** Audit results appear below, grouped by repository in an `Accordion`. Each repository's results are shown in a `Table` listing the error, file, and line number.
    *   **AI Fixes:** After an audit, a "Fix SEO with AI" button appears. Clicking it reveals an "AI Fix Summary" section, also using an `Accordion` to show markdown-formatted fix suggestions for each repo.

3.  **Reports Page (`/dashboard/reports`):**
    *   **KPI Cards:** At the top, there are four `Card` components showing key stats: Overall SEO Score, Critical Issues, Total Audits, and Repositories Monitored.
    *   **Charts:** Two charts visualize data over the last 6 months: a `LineChart` for "SEO Score Over Time" and a `BarChart` for "Issues Breakdown" (critical vs. warnings).
    *   **Recent Audits:** A `Table` at the bottom lists the 5 most recent audits.

4.  **History Page (`/dashboard/history`):**
    *   **Data Table:** A comprehensive `Table` logs all past "Audit" and "Fix" activities.
    *   **Filtering & Searching:** Includes a search `Input`, and `Select` dropdowns to filter by action type (Audit/Fix) and repository, plus a `Popover` with a `Calendar` to filter by date.
    *   **Actions:** Users can download the entire filtered view as a CSV or download individual audit/fix reports as Markdown files from each row.

## Task: Propose UI/UX Enhancements

Based on the description above, provide a list of concrete UI/UX improvements. For each suggestion, please:
1.  **Identify the Page/Component:** Specify which part of the application the enhancement applies to.
2.  **Describe the Enhancement:** Clearly explain the proposed change.
3.  **State the Rationale:** Justify why this change would improve the user experience (e.g., "improves clarity," "reduces cognitive load," "enhances visual appeal," "streamlines workflow").

### Example Suggestion Format:

*   **Page/Component:** Dashboard (`/dashboard`)
*   **Enhancement:** Instead of just showing a loading spinner inside the "Run Audit" button, disable the entire repository selection section during an audit and display a progress bar or a more prominent loading state over the results area.
*   **Rationale:** This provides clearer feedback to the user that a process is running and prevents them from making changes while the audit is in progress, improving the overall user experience and reducing potential confusion.

Now, please provide your list of proposed enhancements.
